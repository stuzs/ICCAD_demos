# *Standard Cell Characterization* for timing and power library preparation
Characterization of a simple two-input AND gate (AND2) cell is demonstrated. The cell timings are characterized and stored in a few NLDM (Non-Linear Delay Model) style 2-D look-up tables (LUTs) for later off-grid indexing based on linear interpolation. Test circuits are provided to evaluate the application of the characterized results.
