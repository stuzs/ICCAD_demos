# ICCAD_demos
ICCAD related code demos in Python for learning basic algorithms and other IC knowledge

The idea of writing then gathering basic ICCAD programs in a place for convenient visit originates from my ICCAD course tutoring. There were Python programs written by students as part of their bachelor theses and I tried to edit some of the code for my graduate course's teaching purpose. Later, I myself wrote more on circuit simulation for showing the computation principles in the course. It is time to create a project holding these pieces together, which might help save the code changes over time and hopefully will inspire more programs to be written for further public access.
